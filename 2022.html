  <h2>Record during <u>rehabilitation</u></h2>

  <p>I made this web page to record my life as web site. It was just vague idea for a long time. But I realize that it's time to do something. Because fortunately(?) I've got free time because of accident. I sprained my right ankle seriously during working, so recently I got a surgery for that. I currently wear the cast for all day, and it makes me not to go outside.

  </p><p>I was planning to go to UK for working but I postponed a bit. I am not sure how long does it take to get well again, but I hope before this autumn. I really want to see fallen leaves of Regent's park.</p><p style="margin-top:420px;">I just find out that write in other language makes the situation seems like less seriously. I like that. 한국인임.</p>
